## Lecture 2-2

**BLAS**:
> * **Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)** is a specification that prescribes a set of low-level routines for performing common linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication.
> * They are the de facto (in reality) standard low-level routines for linear algebra libraries; the routines have bindings for both C ("CBLAS interface") and Fortran ("BLAS interface").

**LAPACK**:
> * **LAPACK ("Linear Algebra Package")** is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition.

\begin{aligned}
    \underbrace{X}_{L U} \,\, \beta &= y\\
    L \,\, \underbrace{\boxed{U \beta}}_{\alpha}&= y\\\,\\
\end{aligned}
$$
> 1. $L \alpha = y$: $O(n^2)$ (solve $\alpha$)
> 2. $U \beta = \alpha$: $O(n^2)$ (solve $\beta$)
> 
> Combine (1) and (2), we can get $\hat{\beta}$
